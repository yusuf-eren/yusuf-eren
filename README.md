Hi, I'm Yusuf. 

I studied Science in High School. I developed Arduino systems in high school and taught them to other students. We developed 7 TUBITAK(The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) projects in my last year. Then I joined FRC in 7536 Anka Robotics. I worked here for 1 year as a software developer.

 After high school, I applied to Computer Programming at Sakarya University.  I graduated 1 week ago. I developed backend applications with NodeJS.

I have a huge interest in payment systems and e-commerce, infrastructures, and technologies. I'm interested in backend and serverless technologies.

I'm always open learn new concepts, developing new technologies, and improving products!
